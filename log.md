### Day 2: October 6th, 2019

**Focus**
I’m new to coding and have accepted the fact that the beginning half of this challenge will be heavier on tutorials and learning than building my own projects from scratch. In taking on the 100daysofcode challenge, I intend push myself to move beyond conceptual learning and really create something tangible. It's a great way to measure and practice documenting my progress.

After seeking external advice I decided to prioritize building some Git skills using the command line. After all, who cares what you can create if you cannot collaborate and communicate with others? Let’s git init! (let the lame puns begin)

**Progress**: 
Installed Git, configured my terminal and code editor
Practiced creating and navigating around directories in the terminal
Created my first repository from scratch

**Thoughts**: This feels harder than expected.

### Day 3: October 7th, 2019

**Focus**
Today I learned and practiced two of the most important Git commands:  git status and git log. 

**Progress**
Cloned an existing repo and changed its name
Learned about git status command and its output
Learned how to navigate and understand git log

**Thoughts** 
While I definitely feel I’m making progress and recognize the importance of this new knowledge, using the terminal still feels like working in a black, unclickable box (thanks Udacity for the metaphor). I’m looking forward to overcoming that feeling.

I also downloaded and experimented with Github Desktop…not for me at this point in time.
