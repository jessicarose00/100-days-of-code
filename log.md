# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 5th, 2019

**Focus**: What better way to kick off my commitment to 100 days of code than attend a one day coding bootcamp? Today I attended "One Day at Bootcamp" hosted by Metis in New York City. The workshop featured lessons on Python, with a focus on Pandas and SciKit Learn. 

**Progress**: Learned about the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning, practiced data analysis with pandas, had a nice intro to linear regression with an example of how to build regression models in scikit-learn

**Thoughts**: While the workshop touched on a broader range of topics than would typically be covered in one day at an immersive bootcamp, it was helpful to get a feel for the pace and structure of the program. It was also a welcome break from self-study, where I'm constantly throwing questions at google/stackoverflow. Being able to pose more complex questions to Metis's Senior Data Scientists and get immediate answers was... heavenly.

### Day 2: October 6th, 2019

**Focus**: I’m new to coding and have accepted the fact that the beginning half of this challenge will be heavier on tutorials and learning than building my own projects from scratch. In taking on the 100daysofcode challenge, I intend push myself to move beyond conceptual learning and really create something tangible. It's a great way to measure and practice documenting my progress.

After seeking external advice I decided to prioritize building some Git skills using the command line. After all, who cares what you can create if you cannot collaborate and communicate with others? Let’s git init! (let the lame puns begin!)

**Progress**: Installed Git, configured my terminal and code editor, practiced creating and navigating around directories in the terminal, created my first repository from scratch

**Thoughts**: This feels harder than expected.

### Day 3: October 7th, 2019

**Focus**
Today I learned and practiced two of the most important Git commands:  git status and git log. 

**Progress**
Cloned an existing repo and changed its name, learned about git status command and its output, learned how to navigate and understand git log

**Thoughts** 
While I definitely feel I’m making progress and recognize the importance of this new knowledge, using the terminal still feels like working in a black, inaccessible box (thanks Udacity for the metaphor). I’m looking forward to overcoming that feeling.

I also downloaded and experimented with Github Desktop… not for me at this point in time.

### Day 4: October 8th, 2019

**Focus**: More focus on the git log command today, including a detailed exploration of each nugget of information the git log command displays.

**Progress**: Learned about the importance of flags to alter how information is displayed, practiced using --oneline, --stat, -p, -w and git show

**Thoughts**: Udacity's course on Version control with Git does a great job of instructing how to navigate git log in the command line. I've use a wide number of resources and really enjoy how this course is designed. Now that I can wrap my head around git log, I can see how valuable this information will be as I move forward in my coding journey.
