# My Activity

### Day 0: October 5th, 2019

**Focus**: What better way to kick off my commitment to 100 days of code than attend a one day coding bootcamp? Today I attended "One Day at Bootcamp" hosted by Metis in New York City. The workshop featured lessons on Python, with a focus on Pandas and SciKit Learn. 

**Progress**: 
- Learned about the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Practiced data analysis with pandas
- Had a nice intro to linear regression with an example of how to build regression models in scikit-learn

**Thoughts**: While the workshop touched on a broader range of topics than would typically be covered in one day at an immersive bootcamp, it was helpful to get a feel for the pace and structure of the program. It was also a welcome break from self-study, where I'm constantly throwing questions at google and stackoverflow. Being able to pose more complex questions to Metis's Senior Data Scientists and get immediate answers was... heavenly.

### Day 1: October 6th, 2019

**Focus**: I’m new to coding and have accepted the fact that the beginning half of this challenge will be heavier on tutorials and learning than building my own projects from scratch. In taking on the 100daysofcode challenge, I intend push myself to move beyond conceptual learning and really create something tangible. It's a great way to measure and practice documenting my progress.  

After seeking external advice I decided to prioritize building some Git skills using the command line. After all, who cares what you can create if you cannot collaborate and communicate with others? Let’s git init! (let the lame puns begin!)

**Progress**: 
- Installed Git
- onfigured my terminal and code editor
- Practiced creating and navigating around directories in the terminal
- Created my first repository from scratch

**Thoughts**: This feels harder than expected.

### Day 2: October 7th, 2019

**Focus**: Learn two of the most important Git commands:  git status and git log. 

**Progress**: 
- Cloned an existing repo and changed its name
- Learned about git status command and its output
- Learned how to navigate and understand git log

**Thoughts**: While I definitely feel I’m making progress and recognize the importance of this new knowledge, using the terminal still feels like working in a black, inaccessible box (thanks Udacity for the metaphor). I’m looking forward to overcoming that feeling.  

I also downloaded and experimented with Github Desktop… not for me at this point in time.

### Day 3: October 8th, 2019

**Focus**: More focus on the git log command today, including a detailed exploration of each nugget of information the git log command displays.

**Progress**: 
- Learned about the importance of flags to alter how information is displayed
- Practiced using --oneline, --stat, -p and -w

**Thoughts**: Udacity's course on Version control with Git does a great job of instructing how to navigate git log in the command line. I've use a wide number of resources and really enjoy how this course is designed. Now that I can wrap my head around git log, I can see how valuable this information will be as I move forward in my coding journey.

### Day 4: October 9th, 2019

**Focus**: Shortcuts with git show.

**Progress**: 
- Figured out how to access and display specific commits with git log and git show
- Practiced using them with SHAs

**Thoughts**: Awesome, I was hoping this existed.

### Day 5: October 10th, 2019

**Focus**: Commit, commit, commit.

**Progress**: 
- Finally wrote my first commit!
- Learned about git add and gathered some tips for how to write a good commit message.

**Thoughts**: To write a good commit message, its helps to imagine I'm finishing this sentence: "This commit will..." and explain *what* the commit does, not *how* or *why*.  It feels a bit pathetic that I’m only at this stage - no pun intended (I warned you) - but I do feel like mastering the terminology and having the confidence to navigate git log and git status wwere important steps. And hey, leaves a whole lot of room for accomplishment over the next 95 days.

### Day 6: October 11th, 2019

**Focus**: Get some practice with markdown by cleaning up my activity log.

**Progress**: 
- Played with the style and format of my activity log, readme and resources files
- Experimented with markdown syntax

**Thoughts**: I'm about to hit the one week mark in this challenge, so cleaning up my activity log was a priority. I haven't been tweeting daily about my progres (opps) which is a main element of this challenge. Now that I feel more comfortable working with markdown and using the command line to push my changes to github there's no excuse!

**Work & Resources**:

### Day 7: October 12th, 2019

**Focus**: Learn a command that allows me to not have to 1) add my files one by one or 2) add all the files in a directory. You guessed it... .gitignore!

**Progress**: 
- Used git diff to see changes that have been made to a file but not committed
- Practiced with .gitignore and globbing

**Thoughts**: Is it just me or do you wish the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) of the glob command was a bit more fascinating than a shortened version of "global"? 

**Work & Resources**:

### Day 8: October 13th, 2019

**Focus**: Today's focus was branches and learning to --decorate my project with tags (even though the log command in Git version 2.13 is automatically decorated)

**Progress**: 
- Added and deleted tags
- Added tags to past commits
- Started delving into the topic of branching

**Thoughts**: With all of this new terminology and commands in my git toolbox, I need to find a project where I can begin to apply this knowledge.

### Day 9: October 14th, 2019

**Focus**: I've been struggling through a data analysis case study as part of my [Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) and decided to take a break from Git to practice creating and manipulating tables with Pandas. I worked through the lessons and quizzes in Codecademy's data science track.

**Progress**: 
- Practiced renaming columns, adding columns to a DataFrame, and using lambda functions to calculate complex quantities

**Thoughts**: With the abundance of online educational resources, my study habits often involve alternating between a few different platforms to learn a new topic. Exploring different teaching methods and exercises helps ingrain the concepts in my head. Plus sometimes a certain explanation just clicks. Anyway, I think I'll dedicate a few more days to Pandas since this will be a crucial tool for data analysis (and I need practice).

### Day 10: October 15th, 2019

**Focus**: Focusing on lambda functions and Pandas again today.

**Progress**: 
- Completed the petal power inventory project

**Thoughts**: The Codecademy projects and lessons sometimes do a little too much hand holding, but whatever I'll take it.

### Day 11: October 16th, 2019

**Focus**: I'm pleased to announce that today was a much smoother day with pandas! Really enforces the power of practice. I was focused on aggregates and learned how to reorganize a data frame with pivoting.

**Progress**: 
- Performed aggregate statistics over rows with groupby 
- Rearranged data frames into pivot tables

**Thoughts**: Codecademy's lessons were a bit buggy so I felt like I lost a lot of time/energy trying to work through the lessons. When I finally gave up I decided to enjoy [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html) useful pandas/SQL comparison guide. I'll post a link to the project I worked on tomorrow if the workspace is able to get over itself.

### Day 12: October 17th, 2019

**Focus**: Back to Git. There's still much fine tuning needed on the data analysis front, but I'm already working with pandas in my courses and am afraid I might start to forget the new Git concepts if I'm not using them regularly (there's a lot of new information entering my brain these days). Today's focus was on branching effectively.

**Progress**:
- Learned how to create, list and delete branches
- Added content to branches
- Practiced switching back and forth between branches

**Thoughts**: I'm going to try and complete this hour of code earlier in the day moving forward. In other news, I downlowded Tableau Desktop and spent a good chunk of today exploring. They have a nice tutorial project that walks you through all the features. I am infatuated.

### Day 13: October 18th, 2019

**Focus**: Merging branches, the beauty and power behind Git. It helps to have a better grasp on how Git merge combines multiple sequences of commits into one unified history.

**Progress**: 
- Learned about the merge command to combine Git branches
- Practiced with regular and fast forward merges in my test project

**Thoughts**: Well, it looks like the word of the day is *merge*. I covered merging branches with Git in my hour of code and merging dataframes with Pandas in my Udacity Nanodegree courses. This is definitely sparking some small brain explosions as I try to keep track of all the definitions, rules and applications, despite the fact that they are completely separate topics. Luckily, I have uncovered about 6,000 different Git cheatsheets (can I get a *merge* please??).

### Day 14: October 20th, 2019

**Focus**: As I progress in my understanding of Git, I'm recognizing the importance of clear, well documented code. I took some time today to explore the common structure and best practices for readme files. I also picked up some more basic markdown syntax.

**Progress**: 
- Learned tips for writing readme files
- [Mastered Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) by adding an image of my merge to yesterday's entry

**Thoughts**: There's even an [emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md). I admit I never knew the shaka :call_me_hand: was formally known as the "call me hand".

### Day 15: October 21st, 2019

**Focus**: Complete Codecademy lessons on working with multiple tables in Pandas. Fix issues that came up during yesterday's Markdown extravaganza

**Progress**: 
- Practiced methods for combining multiple dataframes (i.e. all the different merges and concatenate)

**Thoughts**: For anyone who reads this log 1) sorry 2) thanks! and 3) It may seem like I'm jumping around in my focus, but sometimes I need to dedicate the hour to improving my coding skills for the projects and lessons I can currently apply them to, rather than continually taking on new topics. One of my goals is to be in a position where I can contribute to open source, so learning Git is an important step in that direction, but I accept it's going to be more of a long-term objective. This week I have three concurrent data analysis assignments so Pandas is taking priority.

**Work & Resources**:  
nothing today

### Day 16: October 22nd, 2019

**Focus**: Analyze data on website visits by building a funnel

**Progress**: 
- Use merges to investigate a sales funnel in Codecademy's Page Visits Funnel project

**Thoughts**: This project required some extra thought, extra comments to document my thinking and steps, and even a few sketches. This might be attributable to the fact that I keep leaving my hour of code until the end of the day - argh! Anyway, it was a good exercise in data analysis since it put my merging skills to the test and was a very applicable real-world project. I will review the answers tomorrow to see if I actually calculated everything accurately.

### Day 17: October 23rd, 2019

**Focus**: Attend a [Python Weekly Project Night Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/) in New York to get advice on my #100daysofcode goals and projects

**Progress**: 
- Discovered two new platforms to practice my python skills - see below
- Chatted about ways to contribute to open source projects as a beginner

**Thoughts**: As I mentioned on Day 0, the self-teaching lifestyle can get a little dark hole-ish, so it's always useful to attend events where I can get advice, feedback and ideas from others. NYC Python hosts this meetup every week for people to develop, seek help and refine their Python projects. It was the perfect opportunity to chat with some people about next steps to take with my challenge.

### Day 18: October 24th, 2019

**Focus**: See how many error messages I can receive in one day.

**Progress**: 
Was graced by the following:
- AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'missed'
- UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x9c in position 12: ordinal not in range(128)
- UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x9c in position 12: ordinal not in range(128)
- NameError: name 'attended' is not defined
- ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape
- ValueError: cannot copy sequence with size 14594 to array axis with dimension 14
- KeyError: 'week'

**Thoughts**: GOODNESS. Today was a rough one. I spent an unforgivable amount of time trying to complete two exploratory data analyses. In the beginning I was grappling with some new concepts like the UnicodeDecodeErrors and learning how Python encoding works. But towards the late afternoon I was starting to confuse myself on the simplest aspects and making a general mess of my report. I’m afraid I will have to count these efforts toward my hour of code today, rather than finishing up my Git course.

 ### Day 19: October 25th, 2019

**Focus**: Find out what causes a merge conflict.

**Progress**: 
- Forced a merge conflict and resolved it
- Learned how to interpret merge conflict output and indicators

**Thoughts**: I'm almost at the end of Udacity's Version Control with Git course and marveling at the level of historical tracking and safety Git can provide. It's very cool to see how it all connects. Given yesterday's struggles, I'm especially grateful that when a merge conflict happens, you can simply pop over to your code editor to see the conflict indicators and understand exactly what's going on and where. At least I hope... will only know for sure when I start getting the real merge conflicts!

 ### Day 20: October 26th, 2019

**Focus**: Finish Version Control with Git course.

**Progress**: 
- Learned how to modify and revert commits using git --amend, git revert and git reset
- Learned about relative commit references and reset flags

**Thoughts**: What a relief to have the ability to update my recent commits with git --amend. When I first started writing this log and experimenting with Markdown files I would often make formatting mistakes and only realize it after pushing my updates to Github. I would have to do back to back commits for very minor syntax edits. It's much better to know I can just amend my inital commit (in hindsight, I guess I could have just looked this up but you don't know what you don't know).  

:tada: I'm pumped to know I have the knowledge to create repositories from scratch and review their history, make commits and branches, merge branches, resolve conflicts and undo any changes. I'm looking forward to applying my skills to some practice problems using the Git-it App.

**Work & Resources**:

 ### Day 21: October 28th, 2019

**Focus**: Put my skills to the test by completing all of the beginner challenges in [Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) 

**Progress**: 
- Created a local and remote respository
- Added a collaborator and submitted a pull request

**Thoughts**: This app is great way to reinforce the Git fundamentals I've been learning over the past few weeks. There are a ton of suggested resources for beginner projects, which I plan to explore next.

 ### Day 22: October 30th, 2019

**Focus**: Clean up my 100-days-of-code repository and explore all that Github has to offer.

**Progress**: 
- Updated my readme and resources files
- Clicked on (almost) everything in Github

**Thoughts**: I've been needing to do this for a while.

 ### Day 23: October 31st, 2019

**Focus**: Jump back into Python with some refreshers on dictionaries.

**Progress**: 
- Practiced updating and adding elements to a dictionary
- Used list comprehension to create a dictionary from two lists
- Attempted some CodingBat problems

**Thoughts**: Now that I have a better understanding of Git and the framework for collaborating with others on Github, I'd like to hone my Python skills. I feel like I'm not practicing with enough regularity and don't want to disimprove. The Codecademy lessons and CodingBat challenges are the starting point for today.
