# 100 Days Of Code Challenge
Welcome to my Challenge!

On October 5th, 2019 I committed to coding one hour, every day, for 100 days. Halfway through the challenge, I was accepted to a data science bootcamp and paused (coincidentally coding many hours per day for 12 weeks). I kicked off day 51 on March 31st, 2020.

## Rules
1. I will [tweet](https://twitter.com/taIuIIa) about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
