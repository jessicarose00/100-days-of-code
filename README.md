# 100 Days Of Code Challenge

On October 5th, 2019 I committed to coding one hour, every day, for 100 days. Welcome to my Challenge!

Ultimately, my goal is to build fluency in the tools and software that will help me become an effective data scientist. I plan to focus on more than just improving coding skills by also developing good practices for writing code, structuring projects and communicating or collaboating with others.

I recognize that the original idea behind this challenge is to build projects and not watch tutorials. As a beginner, I don't have much of a choice... but I do aim for tutorials and short courses that require active coding. Full disclosure: I actually couldn't post the first week of activities since I didn't know what a markdown file was. I didn't even have a twitter account.

All in all, self-teaching begs for some degree of interfacing with the online community to measure progress. I want to become more comfortable communicating technical jargon so I can understand what the hell everyone else is talking about. And finally, I want to be held accountable for producing something at the end of my challenge. 

## Rules

1. I will [tweet](https://twitter.com/taIuIIa) about my progress every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress (after day 6).
3. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will diminish my fear of publishing incorrect or messy code. I'm a beginner.
